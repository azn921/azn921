# LlamaIndex create-llama: Getting Started Guide
Welcome to the LlamaIndex create-llama Replit Template! This template lets you quickly create a full-stack web app in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) using [LlamaIndex](https://llamaindex.ai). The app lets you chat with an AI that has read the documents you specify. Just put your documents in the `data` folder and the app will do the rest.

## About create-llama

The app in this template is based on the Next.js app generated by [`create-llama`](https://github.com/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS/tree/main/packages/create-llama), our command-line tool for creating full-stack web apps. If you're interested in creating an app outside of Replit, or using our Python backend instead of full-stack Next.js, check it out.

# Installation & Setup

First, fork this template. Then follow these steps to set up your environment:

## Set OpenAI API Key:

Set your OPENAI_API_KEY using Replit Secrets.

## Launch the App:
Hit the run button.

We've pre-populated your `data` folder with the `Llama2` paper, so you can ask it about that, for instance `Compare Llama2 with Llama1.`

## Add Your Data:

You can add your own data in the folder `llama2_app/data` (you should see the `llama2.pdf` file already in there, you can delete it if you want). Once you've added new data files, hit the run button again to relaunch the app.
